# Space Xplorer - Workflow and Agent System

This project uses a structured workflow with specialized AI agents. **Always refer to the documentation before taking actions.**

## Core Documentation (READ THESE FIRST)

**CRITICAL**: Before any action, read the relevant documentation:

- **[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)** - Complete list of agents, their roles, and available prompts
- **[WORKFLOW.md](../../WORKFLOW.md)** - Complete workflow from issue creation to PR merge
- **[GET_STARTED_WORKFLOW.md](../../GET_STARTED_WORKFLOW.md)** - Quick start guide for using the workflow

## Quick Reference

### Agents
- **Alex** (Product) - `docs/agents/PRODUCT.md`
- **Sam** (Lead Dev) - `docs/agents/LEAD-DEV.md`
- **Morgan** (Architect) - `docs/agents/ARCHITECT.md`
- **Jordan** (Fullstack) - `docs/agents/FULLSTACK-DEV.md`
- **Taylor** (Manager) - `docs/agents/MANAGER.md`

### Key Principles
- Always read documentation before acting
- Update tracking sections immediately after actions
- Loop until perfection at review stages (max 3 iterations)
- Perform final verification after each approval

**For complete details, see the documentation files referenced above.**
